# GENERATIVE-METHODS-IN-GENOMICS-v2
Transformer-based model for creating FASTQ files (extension of thesis topic)

This repository explores the application of generative methods, particularly Transformer models, for addressing the challenge of data scarcity in genomics. The primary focus is on generating synthetic FASTQ files with specified properties, such as quality score distributions and read length variations.

## Transformer Model for FASTQ Generation

This project utilizes a Transformer-based architecture to learn the underlying patterns and characteristics of real FASTQ files and generate new synthetic files that mimic those properties. The model is trained on a dataset of quality scores extracted from real FASTQ files.
